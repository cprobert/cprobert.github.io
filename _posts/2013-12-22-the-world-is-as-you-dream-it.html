<p>I recently came across this YouTube video:</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DfPeprQ7oGc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"></iframe></span>

<p>The cartoon is a bit cheesy but the content is mind blowing, I've never truly understood Schroedinger's cat but it makes a lot more sense when explained in these terms. I'm unable to understand the ramifications of accepting that matter can behave differently when it's observed vs unobserved. It's unintuitive and flies in the face of how I perceive the world around me. Unfortunately I'm completely unequipped to take the consequences of this paradigm from the micro to the macro. If we accept this quantum phenomenon, what does this mean for us at an observable human level?</p>

<p><strong>The World is as You Dream it</strong></p>
<p>It reminds me of a book I once read called "The World is as You Dream it". The idea here is thought itself affects the physical world. I find this concept obvious; ideas have a life of their own and can manifest as rapid spreading meme's. The physical implications of a successful meme are inevitable. Just as observation can affect quantum reality, thought can affect macro reality. For some reason I've created a connection between the two, but I don't know why!</p>
<p>I think it has to do with how I perceive my own reality. I'm an atheist and I believe the scientific method is the best tool we have to understand our own environment. So what do we know about the external environment that our thoughts observe and process?</p>

<p>Assumptions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The universe in infinite</li>
	<li>Time is infinite</li>
	<li>The laws of nature are universal</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Configurations of Sound</strong></p>
<p>An MP3 file is a series of 0 and 1's. So a 3 minute conversation with my family is a specific arrangement of 0 and 1's. A different MP3 containing a Black Sabbath song is another arrangement of 0's and 1's. If we were to rearrange those bits (0's and 1's) we could transform the audio output to a conversation you had with your mother when you were 3 or indeed a conversation you never had with your mother when you were 3. The audio output is a result of the order of the bits in that file. The number of variations of those bits is astronomical if we were to permeate through every single possible combination we would have every speech ever made and not made and yet to be made. We would have every conversation, every song, every sound, including a large amount of unrecognisable noise. When you think about it in o's and 1's every 3 minute MP3 if a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>Configurations of Mass/Energy</strong></p>

<p>If we apply the same rules of permeation as we did for the MP3, within the confines of the assumptions outlined above, then we have to accept infinite physical possibilities. Because space and time are infinite eventually every permutation of space/matter/energy will come to pass; as long as this configuration of space is within the laws of nature.</p>
<p>So, as we exist our very being is proof positive that we are within the laws of nature. This specific configuration of space, it's a one off. Because space and time are infinite it will happen again an infinite amount of times as will variations of your life for both good and bad. It has to it's the inevitable consequence of infinity.</p>
<p><strong>Mutable</strong> <b>Existence</b></p>

<p>What has this to do with the video I watched? Schrodinger's cats teaches us that the cat is both alive and dead until observed. Perhaps everything that can be, and has been is also currently happening. It only coalesces because it is observed/perceived by me/us. This would make time as wide as it is long. Where thought and observation are one and the same thing. So maybe we do control our own destinies purely by thinking our own realities. Is the world really as we dream it?</p>
<p>That's sounds too spiritual for me to be comfortable with, but day by day we learn more about how the universe works in the meantime we should use the time to think. <span class="wp-smiley emoji emoji-smile" title=":)">:)</span></p>
